            The component can be configured through setting attributes.

            While you're developing or testing, you can set your API key using `data-api-key`.
                
                <ably-chat data-api-key="your-api-key-here-for-dev"></ably-chat>

            This is INSECURE. It makes your PRIVATE API key available to the public and you should
            never do this in a production system. It is, however, useful for testing.

            When you're deploying to production you'll want to use `createTokenRequest` to create
            a temporary authentication token. Typically this will involve storing your API key in a
            server side component, and exposing a URL for the Ably SDK to call.

            You can configure this by setting the `data-get-token-url` attribute.

                <ably-chat data-get-token-url="https://my-token-api.com/createTokenRequest"></ably-chat>
            
            This is the recommended way to include Ably API keys in front-end components.
